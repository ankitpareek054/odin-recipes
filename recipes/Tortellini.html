    <img src="" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tortellini is a type of stuffed pasta that originated in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. It is typically ring-shaped and filled with a mixture of meat, cheese, or vegetables. Tortellini is often served in broth or with a sauce, making it a versatile and delicious dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (as needed)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh spinach (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg. Gradually mix the flour into the egg, adding water as needed to form a smooth dough. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, chopped spinach (if using), salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut the dough into 2-inch squares.</li>
        <li>Place a small spoonful of the cheese mixture in the center of each square. Fold the square into a triangle, pressing the edges to seal. Bring the two corners of the triangle together and press to form a ring shape.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tortellini and cook for about 3-5 minutes or until they float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve in broth or with your favorite sauce.</li>
    </ol>
