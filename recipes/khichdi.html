    <img src="" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Khichdi is a traditional Indian dish made from rice and lentils, often cooked with spices and vegetables. It is a comforting and nutritious meal that is easy to digest, making it a popular choice for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Khichdi is often served with yogurt, pickles, or ghee (clarified butter) to enhance its flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yellow moong dal (split yellow lentils)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter) or oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1-2 green chilies, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, beans, etc.), chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice and moong dal together under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak them in water for about 15-20 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or pressure cooker, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the grated ginger and chopped green chilies (if using) to the pot. Sauté for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped mixed vegetables and sauté for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked and drained rice and moong dal to the pot. Stir well to combine with the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder and salt to taste. Mix everything together.</li>
        <li>Pour in 4 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil. If using a pressure cooker, cover it with the lid and cook for 3-4 whistles (about 10-15 minutes). If using a regular pot, cover with a lid and simmer on low heat for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice and dal are cooked and soft. You may need to add more water if it gets too thick.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, fluff the khichdi gently with a fork. Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with yogurt, pickles, or a dollop of ghee on top for added flavor.</li>
    </ol>
