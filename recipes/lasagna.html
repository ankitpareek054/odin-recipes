    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese. It is typically baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, resulting in a hearty and comforting meal that is perfect for family gatherings or special occasions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (24-ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, chopped onion, and minced garlic over medium heat until the beef is browned and the onion is tender. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinara sauce to the skillet with the beef mixture. Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, chopped parsley, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce and topped with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with additional chopped parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
